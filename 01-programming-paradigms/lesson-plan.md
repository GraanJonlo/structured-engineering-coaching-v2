# 01 - Programming paradigms

## Topic

Structured, procedural, object-oriented and functional programming paradigms

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to differentiate between and understand the basic principles of structured, procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.

## Materials

Examples in Polyglot Notebook

## Lesson Activities

### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Introduce the concept of programming paradigms and explain why it is important to understand them
- Provide an overview of the four programming paradigms to be covered in the lesson

### Machine code and assembly (20 mins)

- Explain what machine code and assembly language are, and how they differ from high-level programming languages.
- Discuss how machine code is executed by the computer's hardware, and how assembly language provides a more human-readable representation of machine code.
- Provide example of Hello, World in assembly language

### Structured (20 mins)

- Explain about Edsger Dijkstra and his 1968 paper "Go To Statement Considered Harmful"
- Explain what structured programming is and its basic principles: sequences, selections and loops
- Provide JavaScript example of structured programming
- Discuss how structured programming is discipline imposed upon direct transfer of control
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of structured programming

### Procedural (20 mins)

- Explain about growing complexity in the early 60s
- Explain the need for organisation and modularization
- Provide JavaScript example of procedural programming
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of procedural programming

### Object-oriented (20 mins)

- Explain what object-oriented programming, its basic principles, encapsulation, abstraction and information hiding
- Provide procedural example in C# and show its transformation to OO C#
- Discuss how object-oriented programming is discipline imposed upon indirect transfer of control
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of object-oriented programming

### Functional (20 mins)

- Explain what functional programming is, its basic principles, immutability, pure functions and information hiding
- Provide procedural example in F# and show its transformation to FP F#
- Discuss how functional programming is discipline imposed upon variable assignment
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of functional programming

### Conclusion (5 mins)

- Recap each of the paradigms
- Discuss how SP, OO and FP all take away control to improve code comprehension, maintainability etc.
- Remind the student that these are all abstractions to serve humans and how, under ideal circumstances, all the programming languages would produce identical machine code

## Assessment

Have the student provide a summary of each programming paradigm covered in the lesson and what drove their formation
